# WiFiGenetics-poc
This project uses genetic algorithms to optimize Wi-Fi channel allocation, reducing co-channel interference without brute force. It explores RSSI-based solutions and serves as a proof of concept. Future work includes adding QoS, device data, adjacent interference, integrating neural networks, and testing large-scale deployment feasibility.
